## Top Python Libraries Every Data science Aspirant Must know !


### Pandas

Pandas is a software library written for the python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.

- Pandas is built on top of the NumPy package, meaning a lot of the structure of NumPy is used or replicated in Pandas.
- Data in pandas is often used to feed statistical analysis in SciPy, plotting functions from Matplotlib, and machine learning algorithms in Scikit-learn.
- The primary two components of pandas are the Series and DataFrame.
